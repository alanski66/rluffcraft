    <h3>Experience in Action</h3>
    <p><strong>Pilotlight</strong>: Facilitation and project management for Pilotlight engagements, where charities and senior business leaders collaborate on intensive strategic coaching projects to increase organisational resilience.</p>
    <blockquote>
        "We have really enjoyed the often challenging but healthy Pilotlight process. It has been incredible to have business experts ‘shine a light’ on some areas for development. Like most small charities, we tend to get caught up in the day-to-day firefighting, and this process has given us permission and made us take time to work on strategy and leadership. The Pilotlighters and project manager are also a really nice bunch of people (as well as having varied and useful business expertise) that have filled us with confidence and reconfirmed the unique and challenging nature of what we do."  
        <br>– <strong>Kate Gibbs</strong>, CEO, Swansea Community Farm
